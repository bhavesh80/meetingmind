## Getting Started (Current Status: MVP)

1.  **Invite the Bot:** The MeetingMind bot needs to be invited to your Microsoft Teams meeting. (Specific instructions TBD based on deployment).
2.  **Observe:** The bot will join and begin transcribing the meeting audio.
3.  **View Transcript:** Access the transcript via the configured output method (e.g., console log, file, basic web view).

*(Detailed setup, configuration, and usage instructions will be added as the project progresses beyond the initial MVP.)*

## Technology Stack (Core)

*   **Platform:** Microsoft Teams (via Bot Framework or relevant APIs)
*   **AI:** Cloud-based Speech-to-Text Services (e.g., Azure Cognitive Services, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe)
*   **(Potential):** Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for context awareness, keyword spotting, and summarization.

## Roadmap & Future Plans

*   **MVP:** Focus on core transcription, speaker attribution, and Teams joining capabilities.
*   **Stretch Goals:** Implement basic agenda keyword spotting, interview question prompts, and simple text file output.
*   **Future:**
    *   Enhanced UI/UX within Teams.
    *   Pre-meeting context loading (documents, past notes).
    *   Advanced real-time analysis (summarization, sentiment).
    *   Natural language interaction with the bot.
    *   Persistence and management of notes across meetings/users.
    *   Calendar integration.
    *   Advanced security and multi-tenancy.
