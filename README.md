# MeetingMind: Your AI Meeting Assistant

> Transform your meetings from time-drains to productivity powerhouses with an AI assistant that listens, learns, and leads.

MeetingMind is an intelligent AI assistant designed to integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Teams. It aims to enhance meeting productivity by providing contextual support before, during, and after meetings, automating tedious tasks like note-taking and ensuring key information isn't lost.

## The Problem

Meetings are essential, but often inefficient. Common frustrations include:

*   **Lost Context:** Valuable insights (up to 65%!) are often lost because they aren't documented effectively.
*   **Documentation Burden:** Participants are forced to split focus between engaging in the discussion and taking notes.
*   **Agenda Drift:** Meetings frequently stray from the intended topics, leaving critical points unaddressed.
*   **Missed Questions:** Important questions go unasked as participants lose track of context or discussion flow.
*   **Interview Inconsistency:** Interviewers face the challenge of actively listening, evaluating candidates, and asking relevant questions simultaneously.

## Our Solution: MeetingMind

MeetingMind joins your Microsoft Teams meetings as an AI participant to provide real-time support and post-meeting intelligence.

*   **Before the Meeting:** Analyzes agendas and relevant documents (future goal) to understand context.
*   **During the Meeting:** Actively listens, transcribes the conversation in near real-time with speaker attribution, tracks agenda progress, and can suggest relevant questions or prompts (especially useful for interviews).
*   **After the Meeting:** Delivers structured, searchable notes, highlighting key decisions, action items, and follow-ups.
